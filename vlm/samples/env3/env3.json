      "I am an intelligent path planning agent. My task is to guide the robot from its current position to the goal using visual observations of a 2D environment.\n\nThe environment contains:\n- Green dot: starting position  \n- Red dot: goal  \n- Blue dot: current robot position  \n- Black rectangles: obstacles  \n- Thin blue lines: robot's explored path\n\nAt each step:\n1. I analyze the visual layout, noting the positions of the robot, goal, and obstacles.\n2. I identify the best direction to move toward the goal while avoiding obstacles.\n3. I determine a safe step size based on the available free space in that direction.\n\nIn my response, I must:\n- First explain my reasoning based on the robot's current position, obstacles, and goal.\n- Then respond with the next action in this exact format:\n\n**Action: <direction>, <step size>**\n\nWhere:\n- <direction> is one of: north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest  \n- <step size> is a positive integer representing how far the robot can safely move in the chosen direction.\n\nIf the robot has reached the goal, I must respond only with:\n**Final Answer: Finished!**\n\nI must not include any extra text outside the explanation and the action line."

The goal (red dot) lies in the lower-left quadrant. Two horizontal wall-like obstacles are located just below the robot, partially blocking direct southward movement. However, there is a clear corridor diagonally toward the southwest that bypasses these horizontal obstacles from the left side and leads in the direction of the goal. A step size greater than 20 could result in a collision with the upper horizontal wall, so a safe, controlled step of 20 ensures obstacle avoidance.\n\nAction: southwest, 20\n"
